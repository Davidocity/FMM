One sign that you have reached midlife is that you start to think about how much longer you have to live. [Midlife](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/conditions/midlife) is generally the time between the age of 40 and 65, and this is typically the time when things start to change with our physical, mental, or emotional well-being. We may even begin to think about our "expiration date."
    
According to the [Social Security Actuarial Life Table](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html), the typical male who reaches 40 will die at 78.6. The typical female at 40 will live to see 82.5. Bankrate has a [Life Expectancy Calculator](https://www.bankrate.com/retirement/calculators/life-age-expectancy-calculator/) that you can use to estimate better your life expectancy based on your current state of health. The bottom line is that we all have an expiration date. And whether we officially expire before or after that date, there are many things we can do to maximize how much satisfaction we experience in life.

According to Bankrate's calculator, I have a life expectancy of 82.5 years. Since I am currently 55, that means I (on average) have 27.5 more years to go. While I have gone through 67% of my entire life, I have only gone through 55% of what I will call my independent life. I say this because I left home at the age of 22, the time I began supporting myself as an independent adult.

I feel that I have a lot of life to live, and I want to make the most of it. However, I am not in as good of health as I want to be. That is one of the reasons why I am writing this blog. I hope that it will help me live intentionally and focus on the things that will bring more meaning to my life, beyond watching reruns of James Bond movies.
