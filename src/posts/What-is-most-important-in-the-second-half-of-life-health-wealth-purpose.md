I am a 55-year-old male, and I may be stating the obvious when I say that your quality of life will suffer if you do not have good health. This is especially true in the second half of life. My goal is to have good health until the day that I die, which I estimate to be in about 27.5 years, give or take a few.

I did make a mistake earlier in my life to ignore my health for the sake of more "urgent" matters such as working longer hours or enjoying the wrong foods or alcohol a little too much. I often went months without adequate sleep. A good weekend of sleep was all that I needed to recharge my batteries in my younger years. However, as I hit midlife, the years of neglect took their toll, and now I am in the process of trying to reverse the effects of this neglect.

In the second half of life, we should not sacrifice our health in search of wealth and purpose. Instead, we should understand better how to optimize health to generate more wealth and purpose.

After health, wealth and purpose are both important; they are two sides of the same coin. I want to have enough wealth so that I can live a comfortable, purposeful life. So, in this way, wealth and purpose are intertwined. But, without health, I think that I will find it difficult to enjoy my wealth and purpose fully.

In my next post, I will outline the health issues I faced in 2020 and the actions I have taken (or plan to do) along with the results.
