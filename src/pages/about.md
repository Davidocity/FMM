> **Healthspan**: <br>n. The length of time in one's life where one is healthy.<br>
> **Wealthspan**: <br>n. The length of time one's wealth will support the daily expenses of a person.<br>
> **Purpose**: <br>n. The object toward which one strives or for which something exists; an aim or goal.

This site will focus on examining **health**, **wealth**, and **purpose** from the perspective of someone (me) who is in their second half of life.

As you will learn, I have a few challenges to overcome. I will blog about what I do and why, and then will cover the results. Over the years I have learned a great deal from bloggers and others who have shared their experiences online. In many ways, this site is created so that others might be helped, but it also a way for me to more clearly think about the things I do.

I hope you enjoy this site. Feel free to send me a [message](https://www.findmemore.com/contact/).


Warm regards,<br>
Charles
