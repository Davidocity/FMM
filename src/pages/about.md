> Healthspan: n. The length of time in one's life where one is healthy.

FindMeMore gathers science-based answers and credible insights about maximizing **healthspan** in the second half of life. Living into old age with lousy health is no fun, so FindMeMore seeks to identify ways to extend healthspan. And what do we mean by health? We mean physical strength, mental agility, and spiritual well-being. We need all of these to work their best to live our best life. 

As we transition into the second half of life, the path to a fulfilling, meaningful life can be unclear. The goal of FindMeMore is to research and identify the best knowledge available on how to live a fulfilling and meaningful life.
